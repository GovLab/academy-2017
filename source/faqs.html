      <h3>What is an Academy Coaching Program?</h3>
      <p>It is a hands-on, issue-focused learning and mentoring program designed to help you design and implement solutions to one or another specific type of public interest problem using civic technology. Geared to the purpose-driven participant who is a member of an active team that is passionate about a public problem and already undertaking a project, this program helps you develop a project from idea to implementation. Unlike a traditional accelerator, we focus only on the public interest and only on projects that work with real-world institutions and partners, such as agencies and NGOs, to develop more effective and scalable initiatives.</p>

      <h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
      <p>The coaching programs are  limited enrollment (maximum class size of 10 projects), entirely online, highly customized, and meet every week for 4-5 consecutive weeks or every other week for 8-10 weeks. To help you and your team become more effective, we offer a combination of coaching and skill-building, connection to a network of subject-matter experts, peer to peer mentoring, customized and original learning materials, and frequent and constructive feedback opportunities from a team of teachers and peers at every stage of your agile design-driven process.</p>

      <h3>Where Do the Sessions Meet?</h3>
      <p>Entirely online.</p>

      <h3>How Much Time Will This Take?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Upon admission, faculty and staff will engage with your team to identify opportunities, diagnose problems, and develop a customized reading and research plan.</li>
        <li>Each week, the full group meets online with the faculty for 1-2 hours where one hour is discussion of projects by the group and the second hour is a guest lecture.</li>
        <li>Each week, participants meet on their own in smaller groups.</li>
        <li>Every other week, faculty and staff hold an "office" hour with the team to address project progress.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Who May Participate?</h3>
      <p>Innovators and public entrepreneurs working inside, outside, or in collaboration with public institutions who have: </p>
      <p>And you have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A problem about which they are passionate.</li>
        <li>An open mind to developing innovative approaches that take advantage of technology to bring the broader palette of human expertise to bear on your problem.</li>
        <li>Intellectual curiosity and a willingness to experiment are essential for this course. No formal technology training is assumed or required, but a willingness to play with new tools will be.</li>
        <li>Time and energy to commit to the program activities.</li>
        <li>The drive to do what it takes to develop a project from idea to implementation with the potential of real-world impact for people and communities.

        <p>We will give strong preference to team, as opposed to individual, applications</p>
        <p>*Further preÂ­requisites may apply on specific courses</p>
      </ul>

      <h3>Who will lead each program?</h3>

      <h3>Do I Get Course Credit?</h3>
      <p>Those who successfully complete the requirements will receive an authenticated badge and certificate.</p>

      <h3>How long is the program?</h3>
      <p>The length of each program could be either 4 consecutive weeks or every other week for 8 weeks coaching programs. </p>

      <h3>Do I Have to Pay Something?</h3>
      <p>We are constantly in the search for funding so that we can keep our programs for free or at the minimum cost possible. Because we receive different funding to different programs, the price may vary. However, please do reach out to us if your coaching program has a fee you cannot cover the cost. If admitted, we will do our best to have you participate with us.</p>

      <h3>Who are the Mentors? Can I Pick My Own?</h3>
        <p>Mentors are either subject matter experts working on similar problems or challenges or people who have a track record as effective change agents. The best mentors, of course, are your classmates.</p>
        <p>You can find your own but we commit to helping to pair you with relevant domain experts.</p>

      <h3>This Looks Like a Lot of Work?</h3>
      <p>It is. This is not a simulation but an opportunity to get a real civic tech project closer to implementation. A lot of work will need to get done outside the classroom, including user interviews and background research. Although we take account of the fact that people have other jobs and classes, this is a lot of work but in connection with your passions!</p>

      <h3>Will I receive a certificate upon completion of the program?</h3>
      <p>We will provide a Certificate of Accomplishment for individuals who complete all requirements of each program.</p>
