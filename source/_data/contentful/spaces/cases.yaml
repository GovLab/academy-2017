  background: There are an estimated 4.5 billion mobile phone users across the globe,
    yet approximately 80% of the world’s population has no reliable way to call for
    help in the event of a life-threatening illness or injury. Nonetheless, lack of
    access to basic emergency health care services is a major contributor to health
    disparities between developed and developing nations with low- and middle-income
    countries having substantially higher mortality rates for what would otherwise
    be considered preventable deaths.
  shortDescription: BEACON is a text message-based emergency medical dispatching software
    created by Trek Medics International, and designed specifically for communities
    where consistent ambulance response is not available. By relaying text messages
    from the scene of an emergency to trained responders throughout the community,
    the software enables the nearest available emergency care providers to quickly
    locate, treat and transport emergency victims to local hospitals.
  impact: Our goal is to ensure that 90% of victims requesting emergency assistance
    through the communities we work will be attended to by trained layperson responders
    with access to transport within 10 minutes in urban centers and within 30 minutes
    in peripheral communities. We believe that the minimal human, physical and financial
    resources associated with a text message-based emergency medical dispatch system
    will make the implementation of prehospital care systems possible wherever mobile
    phones are used, providing a sustainable and cost-effective model for other low-resource
    settings.

  background: The U.S. lacks an efficient process for disseminating environmental
    information. People need information to make environmental decisions. The public
    is left depending on corporations and government entities to make environmental
    decisions for them. U.S. citizens rely on a combination of FOIA and some environmental
    law provisions to obtain environmental information which is problematic because
    information is hard to find and understand, FOIA exemptions block access and create
    delays, and agencies use outdated technology. The U.S. part of the Rio Convention,
    which requires parties to give people access to environmental information, but
    U.S. currently fails to do so effectively.
  shortDescription: Right now, environmental information is hard to get, and even
    harder to understand and use. Green Archives will be a well-established source
    for environmental information. It will also go beyond basic information access,
    connecting people with individuals and organizations that can help them ¨translate”
    the complex jargon of environmental information and link them to others interested
    in environmental advocacy and action related to the information they seek. Through
    environmental information access and online connection opportunities, Green Archives
    will connect localized communities with wider networks that may help facilitate
    legislative, judicial, or regulatory community work to face the environmental
    issue at hand.
  impact: This project helps information seekers to obtain and decode environmental
    information as both a functional tool and a vision of what government information
    access in the U.S. could be by providing environmental information gathered from
    proactive FOIA disclosures and FOIA request responses from federal agencies, and
    creating a space for experts to assist information seekers in understanding the
    information contained in the FOIA records. Finally, environmental advocates can
    use the space to find others sharing interests in the same environmental issues.

  background: Linq, the Innovation Lab at the city of Quito, is a space for reinventing
    governance. We see Linq as filling up the -thus far empty- area between civil
    society and local government for co-creating solutions to the most urgent urban
    challenges. We work in three main areas aligned to the Mayor's agenda concerning
    mobility, urban and social issues. We co-create virtually, through a networking-like
    web platform, and soon we will hold dynamic workshops with various interest groups
    to foster such relationships, spot innovative ideas and transform them into disruptive
    solutions.
  shortDescription: LINQ is a space for dialogue and direct collaboration between
    citizens, local and international organizations, colleges, as well as public and
    private sectors; with the purpose of co-creating high impact of solutions to our
    most pressing issues.
  impact: The expected impact of innovating in the public sector is uncertain. However,
    it is practically undeniable that life has greatly changed in the last two decades
    (mainly due to technology), yet government structures have remained virtually
    the same for the past 200 years. The impact of reinventing governance and adapting
    it to current times is thus expected to be immense.

  background: The Participatory Politics Foundation (PPF) is a 510(c)3 non-profit
    with a mission to increase civic engagement. Since 2006, PPF has built free, libre
    and open-source technology for open government and public accountability. In 2007,
    PPF’s flagship OpenCongress launched, and over the next eight years grew to become
    the most-visited non-profit site for tracking the U.S. Congress. PPF brought the
    OpenCongress model to state legislatures with OpenGovernment.org in 2011, and
    continual online conversation with the question-and-answers platform AskThem.io
    in 2014. Now, PPF’s primary project is Councilmatic.org, for city-level open government,
    with the Chicago-based civic tech company DataMade as tech leads. Councilmatic
    was created by Mjumbe Poe as a Code For America Fellow in Philadelphia in 2011
    as an open-source web app. In 2015, PPF and DataMade re-factored the Councilmatic
    open-source code to integrate with the Open Civic Data standard, making it easier
    to set up open-data versions of Councilmatic in more cities.
  shortDescription: 'NYC Councilmatic (http://nyc.councilmatic.org/) is a new website
    for tracking and understanding what’s happening in the NYC Council. It’s free,
    open-source, and has generated the first-ever open data on every legislative action
    in the NYC Council. Councilmatic is a non-profit and non-partisan public resource,
    from the NYC-based Participatory Politics Foundation. It works for individuals
    and organization to access official NYC government info, public event schedules,
    and to hold public discussions about issues in their communities. Coming next:
    email & SMS alerts for committee hearings and council meetings, including agendas
    and minutes.'
  impact: "Councilmatic is currently up in three cities: Chicago, New York City, and
    Philadelphia. Councilmatic is an independent public resource, displaying information
    in the Open Civic Data open standard. The project has unique areas of impact,
    as follows:\n\n- First, it creates new open data on everything in city councils:
    elected officials, committees, public events, and every single legislative item
    - all the bills in city councils - with every action and full text and more.\n-
    A fast, user-focused, mobile-responsive web app\n- Advanced search features to
    filter keyword searches by type of legislation, sponsor, or more\n- Tracking features
    to follow legislative actions over RSS - and coming soon, email and SMS and social
    media\n- Public comment forums (optional) on legislative items, for online discussion
    of local issues\n- SMS outreach (optional) for wider public discussion of community
    priorities\n- “How local government works” help context and legislative process
    explainers\n- Address lookup of local elected officials\n- Maps of geographic
    locations mentioned in bill text\n- Open-data calendar list of upcoming events,
    such as committee hearings or council meetings\n- In Chicago, advanced categorization
    of bills by sub-topic using data analysis of bill text language\n- Filtering options
    to see not just what bills are introduced or recently active, but which were left
    in committee - a meaningful, unique view on introduced legislation that hasn’t
    advanced past committee stages. Useful for journalists and researchers.\n- Forthcoming,
    free embeddable HTML & Javascript widgets for city elected officials, committees
    and any legislative item, for digital media companies\n- In NYC, a free, volunteer
    public dialogue program with “verified” council offices - monthly discussions
    with participating council office staff, to respond online to public comments.
    This program is designed, at about one staff per month, to close the feedback
    loop of civic engagement locally and encourage constituents to post their comments
    on Councilmatic in order to share the response with their community.\n    "

    Challenge 2016” prepare to pitch their ideas of “The most attractive company in
    2020.
  longDescription: "At an historic UN summit in September 2015, world leaders formally
    committed to the set of 17 “sustainable development goals” that form the heart
    of the UN’s ambitious 2030 Agenda. The 8th of these goals calls for the promotion
    of inclusive and sustainable economic development, full and productive employment,
    and decent work for all. Everyone understands that achieving these noble outcomes
    will, inevitably, require meaningful changes in public policy. But it will also
    require deep changes in what private sector institutions do and, every bit as
    important, in the ways they organize themselves to do it.\n\nWhen individuals
    at work feel unheard, unseen, and undervalued, their daily experience on the job
    alienates instead of engages. When they feel unable to make real contributions
    because the levers for doing so lie well out of reach, fat paychecks flowing to
    the accounts of distant barons offer neither satisfaction nor incentive, but only
    fuel for discontent and anger. This has always been true. For the millennials
    now and soon to be in the workforce, the truth goes deeper still. Their expectations
    are higher, their skills greater, and their patience lower than those of the generations
    before them. They are poised to contribute and have much to contribute. If their
    work offers them no effective means to do so, they will be frustrated and all
    of society will be the poorer – and the more fragile.\n\nIn practice, this means
    that corporate MANAGERS will need to find new and compelling ways in which to
    tap, harness, and leverage the knowledge, skills, energy, and commitment of theIR
    millennial COLLEAGUES. Companies, positions, and work assignments must do more
    than just organize and support them. They must energize and engage them. Indeed,
    every plausible road to SDG 8 passes through the gate of engagement. \n\nAccordingly,
    Citizen Cyberlab, The GovLab , Nestlé and the Alliance4YOUTH partners are sponsoring
    a challenge for up to 80 students from across Swiss universities. Teams of no
    more than 5 or 6 from across universities will each choose a sector within which
    to focus and, then, devise an integrated plan for how a company operating in that
    sector can best use available tools, diagnostic frameworks, information and social
    technologies, and managerial approaches to engage and energize their people.\n\nEvery
    week for 5 weeks, beginning October 2016, all teams will have access to a 2 hour,
    on-line expert coaching session, which is designed to support them in framing
    the challenge as they think best, managing team process and dynamics, becoming
    familiar with relevant information and social technologies, and putting together
    and rehearsing their final “pitch” – a 10 minute-per-team presentation, followed
    by 5 minutes of Q&A – for delivery on 23 November at Nestle in Geneva to a judging
    panel including A4Y members and a UN representative. Prizes will be given for
    the best overall pitch and the best presentation."
  courseFormat: 1 faculty-led session every week for 2 hours with presentations from
    representatives of partner organizations and feedback from the coaches for each
    team’s presentation on the topic of the week leading up to one “final” pitch at
    Nestle in Geneva to a judging panel including A4Y members and a UN representative.

  shortDescription: The second offering of a coaching program for teams and individuals
    working on empirically-based criminal justice innovation projects, including those
    working in criminal justice, health, mental health and related agencies as well
    as researchers and advocates.
  longDescription: "The Coaching Program for Data Driven Criminal Justice Projects
    has support from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation and is run in partnership
    with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (and its efforts
    to accelerate more city, county and states willing to adopt voluntary, data-driven
    approaches to improve public health and safety, and reduce unnecessary incarceration).\n\nThe
    program is the second iteration of a successful first-of-its-kind offering earlier
    in the summer that brought together 20 teams from 12 states in a fortnightly online
    convening format which included guest lectures by subject matter experts, one-on-one
    mentoring sessions and peer-to-peer interaction. The program seeks to assist teams
    and individuals working on empirically-based criminal justice innovation projects,
    including those working in criminal justice, health, mental health and related
    agencies as well as researchers and advocates, and who share a common desire to
    make greater use of data to understand past performance, improve day-to-day operations,
    and develop innovative approaches to the operations of the criminal justice system.\n\nPerhaps
    you want to combine arrest data with Medicaid hospitalization data to identify
    the super-utilizers of both systems? Or you are stuck trying to figure out the
    applicable legal and privacy protections inhibiting the creation of data exchanges?
    Maybe you want to identify which social service alternatives to incarceration
    are working, when and for whom, and which are not? Have you developed a new algorithm
    for determining pre-trial release? \n\nThis program is offered in response to
    what we are hearing from you about the demand for more help, expertise and capacity
    building to enable you to make better use of data both to understand past performance
    and to improve day-to-day operations of criminal justice in your communities.\n\nEvery
    other week for ten weeks, participants will come together to learn both from one
    another and from experts in responsible data sharing practices. Participants also
    receive personalized project management coaching designed to help you overcome
    the specific barriers to implementation you are facing.\n\nThe program is intended
    for those with a data driven criminal justice innovation project in mind. It is
    not a lecture course in data science but a hands-on, customized coaching and mentoring
    program for teams or individuals. It is designed to help you bring your project
    from idea to fruition. The program follows the outlines of our public problem
    solving method but is flexibly configured to be responsive to your specific needs.\n\nWith
    implementation as our lodestar, we will focus together on developing the essential
    aspects of the projects at each stage."
  courseFormat: 1 faculty-led session every other week for 2 hours (one hour is with
    a guest expert and one hour is an all-group session); and a personalized schedule
    of peer-to-peer and one-on-one coaching sessions.
  moreInformation: |-
    - If accepted, participants are asked to complete a questionnaire about their projects to aid with up-front diagnosis of challenges and the design of a customized support curriculum.

    - Thanks to a generous grant from the Arnold Foundation, the program is free of charge to participants. However, participants are expected to commit to the duration of the program.

  endDate: !ruby/object:DateTime 2016-11-07 00:00:00.000000000 -05:00

  shortDescription: Led by New York City Council member Ben Kallos, this program is
    designed to convene government, social and civic entrepreneurs who are developing
    projects around the automation and delivery of benefits and services for citizens.
  longDescription: |-
    For many low-income citizens, getting access to benefits for which they are already eligible requires them to negotiate a minefield of forms, websites and duplicate documentation. Technology can improve government and organizational efficiency and ensure that thousands of citizens don’t lose out on benefits simply by enabling the automation of enrollment and renewal of people into the system. Recertifications can be automatic rather than arduous, eliminating repetitive paperwork and allowing people to get what they need and the government to reduce administrative costs.

    Innovations in Automatic Benefits for Citizens is a ten week online coaching program designed to convene government, social and civic entrepreneurs (both individuals and teams) who are developing projects around the automation and delivery of benefits and services for citizens. With expert guidance from Councilmember Ben Kallos, Chair of the Committee on Governmental Operations of the New York City Council, we will help you to understand the operational flow of government as well as how to start building free and open source tools and/or bridge them with resources like OpenFisca and CiviCRM.

    Whether your project is nonprofit or for-profit, this program aims, through peer-to-peer support and expert coaching and mentoring, to help innovators design, implement, scale, and assess effective projects.
  courseFormat: 1 faculty-led session every other week for 2 hours (one hour is with
    a guest expert and one hour is an all-group session); and a personalized schedule
    of peer-to-peer and one-on-one coaching sessions.

  longDescription: |-
    Innovations in Disaster Management is a ten week online coaching program designed to convene government, social and civic entrepreneurs (both individuals and teams) who are developing projects that have the potential to tackle the pressing needs of people in disaster-affected communities. Whether your project is nonprofit or for-profit and whether you are focusing on disaster preparedness, disaster management or disaster relief, this program aims, through peer-to-peer support and expert coaching and mentoring, to help humanitarian innovators implement, scale, and assess effective projects.

    Ideal participants are those who have already identified a project and/or have a project underway and have clear insight into the problem they are trying to ameliorate. Projects might aim to tackle diverse issues from the protection of vulnerable populations, to strengthening health initiatives, to providing shelter, education, and livelihood opportunities. They will have in common the application of open, data-driven, bottom-up and collaborative approaches. A public interest and public engagement focus should ultimately be the driving force behind the projects.

    The GovLab Academy coaching programs have helped 450 government, social and civic entrepreneurs take 250 projects from idea to implementation. We aim to help you “cross the chasm” from idea to implementation and help you scale.
  courseFormat: 1 faculty-led session every other week for 2 hours (one hour is with
    a guest expert and one hour is an all-group session); and a personalized schedule
    of peer-to-peer and one-on-one coaching sessions.
  moreInformation: "- Fee: $250 per project. Each project can have a team of up to
    5 participants.\n\n- The $250 fee helps to cover the stipend that we offer to
    coaches to compensate them for their time. We hope to offer financial aid scholarships
    to help international teams that would otherwise not be able to participate in
    the coaching program due to financial constraints. If your team would like to
    be considered for a scholarship (should your project be selected), please check
    the box in your application. More details will follow. "
